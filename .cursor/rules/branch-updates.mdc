# Branch Push Rule

## Push to "nihals-branch"
- Always commit and push meaningful changes to the branch `nihals-branch`
- Avoid pushing trivial or experimental changes; commit only when the update adds value
- Ensure changes are tested and code follows clean code guidelines before pushing

## Commit Practices
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages that explain the "why" behind the change
- Keep commits small, focused, and logically grouped
- Reference issue numbers or tasks in commit messages when applicable

## Workflow
- Make local changes → run tests → commit → push to `nihals-branch`
- Rebase frequently to keep the branch up to date with main
- Create feature branches only when absolutely necessary, but merge back into `nihals-branch`
